# 🚀 Blockchain Miner

## 📌 Overview
This is a **basic blockchain mining simulation** implemented in Python. It creates a blockchain where each block contains transactions, a hash, and a proof-of-work mechanism. The program simulates mining blocks with increasing difficulty.

## ⚙️ Features
- **SHA-256 hashing** for transaction integrity 🛡️
- **Proof-of-Work mining** ⛏️
- **Blockchain structure with linked blocks** 🔗
- **Transaction generator** 📝
- **Adjustable mining difficulty** 🎯

## 📂 Project Structure
```
miner/
│── start_miner.py  # Main script to run the blockchain miner
│── README.md       # Project documentation
│── .gitignore      # Files to ignore in version control
```

## 🏗️ How It Works
1. A **transaction generator** creates transactions and hashes them using SHA-256.
2. A **block** stores transactions and includes a proof-of-work system.
3. The **miner** keeps incrementing the nonce until it finds a valid hash below the target difficulty.
4. Once mined, the block is added to the blockchain, and a new block begins.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/miner.git
   cd miner
   ```
2. **Run the Python script**
   ```bash
   python start_miner.py
   ```

## 🎮 Usage
- The script will generate transactions and mine blocks until the blockchain is formed.
- Difficulty increases with each new block.
- The mining process prints out relevant details, including attempts needed to mine a block.

## 🔥 Example Output
```
Current block hash: 000abcd123... with target 000dddddddd...
Block mined!
It took 34523 tries to mine the block!
```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations
- Uses **SHA-256** for hashing.
- Implements **Proof-of-Work** to prevent easy block manipulation.
